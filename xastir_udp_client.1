.SH NAME
xastir_udp_client \- send simple messages to xastir for APRS(tm) network.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xastir_udp_client
.I <hostname> <port> <callsign> <passcode> {-identify | [-to_rf] <message>}

.SH DESCRIPTION

xastir_udp_client sends packets into the UDP listening port of an enabled xastir instance.

.SH EXAMPLES

 xastir_udp_client localhost 2023 <callsign> <passcode> "APRS Packet Goes Here"

Currently that will inject the packet into Xastir's decoding routines and send
it to any TCP-connected clients. It will also igate it to the INET if you have
igating enabled.  It will send the packet out the RF ports as third-party
packets only if you add the "\-to_rf" flag after the passcode like this:

 xastir_udp_client localhost 2023 <callsign> <passcode> \-to_rf "APRS Packet"

The UDP client is useful for generating and injecting APRS packets from
external scripts.  It can also be used to fetch the callsign of the remote
xastir server by using the \-identify flag:

 xastir_udp_client localhost 2023 <callsign> <passcode> \-identify

.SH NOTES
This is a very simple utility that provides no validation of message
content.  The text passed as the last argument is directly injected
into Xastir's incoming data stream and processed exactly as if it had
come out of a TNC.

As such, the text passed to it as "APRS Packet" must be a complete
APRS packet, including FROM and TO call signs, not simply the payload.
Thus to have it work properly, you should pass
"MYCALL-0>APX219:payload goes here" as the string, not "payload goes
here" (where obviously you should replace "MYCALL-0" with your own
callsign and SSID).
